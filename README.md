# Traffic Sign Classification Deep Learning Project using Python
Traffic sign classification is an essential component of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) for enhancing safety of road users. Given the poor quality of traffic sign images and the resulting challenge of accurately recognizing traffic signs, the optimization of traffic sign classification systems is warranted to provide precise warnings and guidance to road users as they navigate their vehicles. Pre-trained Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have emerged as a viable tool for traffic sign classification tasks in recent years. However, most studies in traffic sign classification used pre-trained models as a standalone feature extractor and neglected the fine-tuning approach. Since pre-trained models are trained on other large-scale datasets, it is important to investigate the optimal approach for adapting pre-trained models to the traffic sign classification task. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the performance of three transfer learning approaches, standalone feature extraction, block-wise fine-tuning and layer-wise fine-tuning. 

# Methodology
The transfer learning architecture trained on the ImageNet dataset, VGG_16 is used due to its remarkable performance in past traffic sign classification studies. Image pre-processing techniques such as normalization and data augmentation are carried out to improve the quality and diversity of traffic sign images.
